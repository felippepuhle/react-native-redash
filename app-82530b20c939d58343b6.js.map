Integrate with your platform specific scroll\n * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\n * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n * ===============================\n *\n *\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\n\nvar States = {\n  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER',\n  // Not the responder\n

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\n\nvar VirtualizedList =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n  _inheritsLoose(VirtualizedList, _React$PureComponent);\n\n  var _proto = VirtualizedList.prototype; // scrollToEnd may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n\n  _proto.scrollToEnd = function scrollToEnd(params) {\n    var animated = params ? params.animated : true;\n    var veryLast = this.props.getItemCount(this.props.data) - 1;\n\n    var frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(veryLast);\n\n    var offset = Math.max(0, frame.offset + frame.length + this._footerLength - this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength);\n    /* $FlowFixMe(>=0.53.0 site=react_native_fb,react_native_oss) This comment\n     * suppresses an error when upgrading Flow's support for React.

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n * Also inherits [ScrollView Props](docs/scrollview.html#props), unless it is nested in another FlatList of same orientation.\n */\n\n\nvar FlatList =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n  _inheritsLoose(FlatList, _React$PureComponent);\n\n  var _proto = FlatList.prototype;\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the end of the content.

Check out this\n * [blog post](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/better-list-views.html)\n * for more details.\n *\n * ListView - A core component designed for efficient display of vertically\n * scrolling lists of changing data. The minimal API is to create a\n * [`ListView.DataSource`](docs/listviewdatasource.html), populate it with a simple\n * array of data blobs, and instantiate a `ListView` component with that data\n * source and a `renderRow` callback which takes a blob from the data array and\n * returns a renderable component.\n *\n * Minimal example:\n *\n * ```\n * class MyComponent extends Component {\n *   constructor() {\n *     super();\n *     const ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});\n *     this.state = {\n *       dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows(['row 1', 'row 2']),\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <ListView\n *         dataSource={this.state.dataSource}\n *         renderRow={(rowData) => <Text>{rowData}</Text>}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ListView also supports more advanced features, including sections with sticky\n * section headers, header and footer support, callbacks on reaching the end of\n * the available data (`onEndReached`) and on the set of rows that are visible\n * in the device viewport change (`onChangeVisibleRows`), and several\n * performance optimizations.\n *\n * There are a few performance operations designed to make ListView scroll\n * smoothly while dynamically loading potentially very large (or conceptually\n * infinite) data sets:\n *\n *  * Only re-render changed rows - the rowHasChanged function provided to the\n *    data source tells the ListView if it needs to re-render a row because the\n *    source data has changed - see ListViewDataSource for more details.\n *\n *  * Rate-limited row rendering - By default, only one row is rendered per\n *    event-loop (customizable with the `pageSize` prop). This breaks up the\n *    work into smaller chunks to reduce the chance of dropping frames while\n *    rendering rows.\n */\n\nvar ListView = createReactClass({\n  displayName: 'ListView',\n  _childFrames: [],\n  _sentEndForContentLength: null,\n  _scrollComponent: null,\n  _prevRenderedRowsCount: 0,\n  _visibleRows: {},\n  scrollProperties: {},\n  mixins: [ScrollResponder.Mixin, TimerMixin],\n  statics: {\n    DataSource: ListViewDataSource\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * You must provide a renderRow function.

This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see\n *   blank content.
